An exclusion of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking (GMSB) at 95\% confidence
level is made in the squark mass vs gluino mass parameter space using
$1.1\unit{fb^{-1}}$ of proton-proton collisions data from the Large Hadron
Collider (LHC). The event selection is based on the strong production GMSB 
signature of photons, jets and missing transverse energy. The missing transverse 
energy ($\MET$) is finally used to distinguish signal from background. The 
background is estimated using a data driven technique. The CLs method is used to 
exclude GMSB models with squark mass and gluino mass up to around $1\unit{TeV}$.
