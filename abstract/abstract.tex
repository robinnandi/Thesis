An exclusion of Gauge Mediated Supersymmetry Breaking at 95\% confidence level 
is made in the squark mass vs gluino mass parameter space using
$1.1\unit{fb^{-1}}$ of proton-proton collisions data from the Large Hadron
Collider. The event selection is based on the strong production signature of 
photons, jets and missing transverse energy. Missing transverse energy is used 
to distinguish signal from background. The background is estimated with a data 
driven technique. The CLs method is used to exclude models with squark mass and 
gluino mass up to around $1\unit{TeV}$.
