\section{Units and Conventions}

{\bf Special Relativity} \\

All energies, momenta and masses are given in units of energy (e.g. GeV) with
$c=1$ to naturally embody special relativity. \\

For lengths and times where special relativity is not important (e.g. detector
size) metres (m) and seconds (s) will be used. \\

{\bf Indices} \\

Greek letters (e.g. $\alpha$, $\mu$) are reserved for lorentz indices and take
values 0, 1, 2, 3 with the 0-index corresponding to the energy/time component
and the other indices corresponding to the momentum/spatial components. \\

Latin letters (e.g. a, i) are used for all other index requirements. \\

Following Einstein's summation convention repeated indices are summed over. For 
example, the component of the spin $s_{a}$ in the direction of the momentum 
$p_{a}$ is written $s_{a}p_{a}$ (Equation \ref{eq:latinsum}).

\begin{eqnarray}
s_{a}p_{a} &=& s_{1}p_{1} + s_{2}p_{2} + s_{3}p_{3} \nonumber \\
&=& \vec{s}\cdot\vec{p}
\label{eq:latinsum}
\end{eqnarray}

When lorentz indices are involved use of the minkowski metric $\eta_{\mu\nu} =
\mathrm{diag}(1, -1, -1, -1)$ is implied. In this thesis there is no distinction 
between ``up'' indices (e.g. $p^{\mu}$) and ``down'' indices (e.g. $p_{\mu}$). 
For example, the invariant mass of a particle with four-momentum $p_{\mu}$ is 
$p_{\mu}p_{\mu}$ (Equation \ref{eq:greeksum}). 

\begin{eqnarray}
p_{\mu}p_{\mu} &=& p_{0}p_{0} - p_{1}p_{1} - p_{2}p_{2} - p_{3}p_{3} \nonumber
\\
&=& E^{2} - |\vec{p}|^{2} \nonumber \\
&=& m^{2}
\label{eq:greeksum}
\end{eqnarray}

{\bf Detector Co-ordinates} \\

The CMS detector has a cylindrical structure with a barrel and two end-caps. 
Cylindrical co-ordinates ($\rho$, $z$, $\phi$) are used to describe radius from
the beampipe and position of primary vertices from the interaction point.

Spherical polar co-ordinates ($r$, $\theta$, $\phi$) are used for

\section{Other Work}

I spent the first six months of my Ph.D. attending lectures on particle physics 
and doing problem sheets and training exercises. Following this I went to CERN
for two years. I lived in an appartment in Meyrin. \\

For the next year I worked alongside David Wardrope within the Electroweak group 
on a technique called ``Ersatz $\MET$'' to obtain a $\MET$ template for W events 
from data. This involved learning about electron and photon reconstruction. This 
is an important part of the W cross-section measurement. \\

For the next 1.5 years I was working within the SUSY group at Imperial College 
on using kinematic variables to search for SUSY. Using my experience with 
electrons and photons, I looked at GMSB which predicts a final state with 
photons, jets and $\MET$. This work forms the main subject of this thesis. I
also helped maintain the analysis code and produced n-tuples from the data for
analysis by others in the group. I presented my work at regular meetings to the
wider SUSY group in the CMS collaboration. \\

During my time at CERN I did trigger shifts and ECAL shifts in the control room 
at Point 5 (the site of the CMS detector) near Cessy in France. I also did other
service work relating to anomalous energy deposits in the ECAL (``spikes''). \\

For the final six months I returned to Imperial College to write up my thesis.
\\

There are two big projects which I have worked on during my Ph.D., but which are
not contained within the main part of this thesis. I will mention them briefly
here. They are the work on ECAL spikes and Ersatz $\MET$ mentioned above. \\
