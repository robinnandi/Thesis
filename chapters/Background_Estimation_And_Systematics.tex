\chapter{Background Estimation and Systematics}

\section{Introduction}

\section{Backgrounds}

QCD is the laregest background. QCD events are balanced. Any missing transverse
energy comes from detector imperfections. There are three different components 
to the QCD background:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Fakes from jets ($\pi^{0}\rightarrow\gamma\gamma$):} $\pi^{0}$s are
one of the main constituents of jets. The two photons from a high energy 
$\pi^{0}$ can easily be mistaken for a single photon. Most $\pi^{0}$s in jets
will be non-isolated due to the surronding HCAL energy and tracks. However
there is a distribution of isolation and given the large cross section of QCD, 
some of these events will end up in the isolated tail.
\item {\bf Prompt $\gamma$+jet:} In these events the photon comes directly from
the parton hard scattering. The other jet can come from gluon radiation or
jet fragmentation. These events contain prompt photons which tend to be isolated
and have good shower shape. The $\pT$ of the photons is distributed around half
the $\HT$ of the event.
\item {\bf QCD jets with ISR/FSR:} A QCD jets event where an initial state quark
or final state quark radiates a photon. These events also contain prompt photons
which tend to be isolated and have good shower shape. The cross section of this 
process falls with the $\pT$ of the photon. 
\end{itemize}

The Electroweak background is small in comparison to the QCD background.
Electroweak processes can contribute real $\MET$ by the neutrino which is not
detected by CMS. The cross section of electroweak processes is much lower than
that of QCD and this rules out any background due to fakes from jets. There are
two possible sources of photons: $W\rightarrow e\nu$ where the electron has been
misidentied as a photon or $\gamma Z\rightarrow\gamma\nu\nu$ which has a real
photon. \\

The $t\bar{t}$ background has real photons and real $\MET$, but it is negligible 
due to the low cross section. The $t\bar{t}$ background is estimated using Monte
Carlo.

\section{QCD Background}
\label{sec:QCD_Background}

All three sources of QCD background have fake $\MET$ due to detector effects.
Fake $\MET$ can come from the HCAL resolution or from severe mismeasurements
such as dead ECAL Trigger Towers or poor HCAL response. \\

ECAL Trigger Towers are $5\times5$ arrays of crystals in the ECAL with the
photodetectors behind them and the electronics to trigger and read out the data. 
There are $82\times72$ trigger towers in the ECAL barrel. Some of these Trigger
Towers are dead i.e. there is no data coming from them. This means that any
objects going down a dead Trigger Tower will be missed causing fake $\MET$. The 
number of dead Trigger Towers may vary from run to run as those with a problem 
are masked and those which have been fixed are unmasked. Some ECAL Trigger 
Towers have long-term problems. There are about XX dead ECAL TTs: YY of these 
have trigger information available. Figure \ref{fig:Dead_ECAL_TTs} shows a map 
of ECAL Trigger Towers. \\

Poor HCAL response is another cause of large fake $\MET$. Sometimes a jet is
reconstructed with a much lower $\pT$ than it actually has. Such mismeasurements
are extremely pathelogical and not at all well understood. These are not
correlated with any specific region of the detector. \\

The core resolution is approximately Gaussian in x and y components of $\MET$ 
while the severe mismeasurements contribute a non-Gaussian tail to the $\MET$ 
distribution. Both components scale up with $\HT$. The core resolution scales as
$\sim\sqrt{\HT}$ while the tails increase because higher $\HT$ events contain 
higher $\pT$ objects which give larger $\MET$ when missed. \\

Any background estimation method needs to be able to estimate these detector 
effects. If the Monte Carlo were to be used we would be relying on its ability 
to correctly model all the causes of fake $\MET$. Not just the core resolution 
but also the $\MET$ tail with severe mismeasurements. Using a control sample 
from data gives a perfect simulation of the CMS detector. The problem is reduced
to finding a control sample with the same kinematic properties as the selected 
sample rather than trying to simulate the most extreme elements of detector
response. \\

A control sample is defined to contain events which pass all the selection 
criteria except for the isolation. This control sample is used to estimate the
$\MET$ shape of the QCD background in each $\HT$ bin. The absolute number of
events is obtained by normalising the $\MET$ distribution to the number of
events with $\MET < 50 \GeV$. \\

The assumption in this method is that the control sample has the same $\MET$
distribution as the selected sample in each $\HT$ bin. The control sample is
very similar to the selected sample. It has the same objects with the same
kinematic cuts. All events contain at least one photon with good shower shape.
The only difference is that in the control sample the photon is non-isolated
while in the selected sample it happens to be isolated. Although they contain
the three sources of QCD background in different proportions, in both cases the 
source of $\MET$ is the same: detector effects. So we can expect them to have 
the same $\MET$ distributions. \\

The background estimation is shown to work in Monte Carlo and in data using a 
sideband region. Figure \ref{fig:Regions} shows the regions used for the
background estimation. The (non-isolated) control sample is used to estimate the 
background in the (isolated) selected sample. The sideband region is used to
check that the background estimation works i.e. the non-isolated and isolated 
samples have the same $\MET$ distribution. \\

\caption{A graphic showing the layout of the regions used for the QCD background
estimation. The control sample is used to estimate the $\MET$ distribution in
the selected sample. The sideband region is used to check that the background
estimation works.}
\label{fig:Regions}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Bkgd_Est_MC} shows the background estimation and the number of
selected events in bins of $\HT$ and $\MET$ for the Monte Carlo. \\

in bins of $\HT$ and $\MET$ in the Monte Carlo to check that the background
estimation method works.}
\label{fig:Bkgd_Est_MC}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:Bkgd_Est_Sideband} shows the estimation of the number of
isolated events in bins of $\HT$ and $\MET$ using the non-isolated sample in the
sideband region from data compared to the true number of events. \\

\begin{figure}

\caption{The estimation of the number of isolated events (left) using the
non-isolated events in the sideband region from data compared to the true number
(right).}
\label{fig:Bkgd_Est_Sideband}
\end{figure}

A systematic error on the assumption is taken as half the difference between the
estimated number of events and true number of events in Monte Carlo.

\section{Electroweak Background}

Electroweak processes can have real MET due to neutrinos which are not
detected by CMS. There are two components to the electroweak background:
$W\rightarrow e\nu$, where the electron is misidentified as a photon and 
$\gamma Z\rightarrow\gamma\nu\nu$, which has a real photon and real MET. \\

The $W\rightarrow e\nu$ background is estimated by measuring the electron/photon
misidentification rate in data. \\

The $\gamma Z\rightarrow\gamma\nu\nu$ background is estimated from Monte Carlo.

\section{Electron/Photon Fake Rate}

Measuring the fraction of electrons that are misidentified as photons is
important for estimating the background coming from $W\rightarrow e\nu$ events
where the electron is misidentified as a photon. \\

With a fake rate, $f_{e\rightarrow\gamma}$, and given a true number of
$Z\rightarrow ee$ events, $N_{Z}$, the number of events in the ee sample is
given by $N_{ee} = (1 - f_{e\rightarrow\gamma})^{2}N_{Z}$. And the number of
events in the e$\gamma$ is given by $N_{e\gamma} = 2[f_{e\rightarrow\gamma}(1 -
f_{e\rightarrow\gamma})]N_{Z}$. With measurements of $N_{ee}$ and $N_{e\gamma}$
the fake rate can be determined as $f_{e\rightarrow\gamma} =
N_{e\gamma}/(2N_{ee} + N_{e\gamma})$. \\

The fake rate is measured using an ee sample and an e$\gamma$ sample from data.
Electrons are selected using the same requirements as photons, but with a pixel
seed required (rather than no pixel seed). The number of $Z\rightarrow ee$
events in each sample is determined by fitting a Crystal Ball function with a
linear background assumption (Figure \ref{fig:Zee_Fit}). There is no significant
difference in the yields if a constsnt or quadratic background shape is used. \\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=1.0\textwidth]{Zee_Fit.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The invariant mass of ee and e$\gamma$ candidates. The Z peak is fitted
using a Crystal Ball function and a linear background.}
\label{fig:Zee_Fit}
\end{figure}

The fit of the Z peak in the ee sample yields $69639 \pm 290$ Z events. Fitting
the Z peak in the e$\gamma$ sample yield $1952\pm56$ Z events. From these
numbers the misidentification rate is $f_{e\rightarrow\gamma} = 0.014\pm0.004$.
This number varies little as a function of e or $\gamma$ $p_{T}$. Based on the
variations with $p_{T}$ a systematic uncertainty of 0.002 is assigned to
$f_{e\rightarrow\gamma}$. 

\section{Photon Efficiency}

The photon efficiency needs to be determined to calculate the signal efficiency.
The photon efficiency could be found using the MC, but that relies heavily on
the correct modelling of the shower shape, isolation and other variables which
may not be well modelled in the MC. The photon efficiency should be measured
from data. In the absence of any pure photon sample in the data, electrons from 
$Z\rightarrow ee$ events are used. This relies on the similarity in detector 
response between electrons and photons. A scale factor to correct the MC photon
efficiency to the real photon efficiency in data is obtained using the
electrons (Equation \ref{eq:Scale_Factor}). \\

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\gamma}^{data} = \frac{\epsilon_{e}^{data}}{\epsilon_{\gamma}^{MC}}
\times \epsilon_{\gamma}^{MC}
\label{eq:Scale_Factor}
\end{equation}  

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon_{\gamma}^{data}$ = photon efficiency in data;
\item $\epsilon_{\gamma}^{MC}$ = photon efficiency in MC;
\item $\epsilon_{e}^{data}$ = electron efficiency obtained using $Z\rightarrow
ee$ events in data that satisfy the photon selection; 
\item $\epsilon_{e}^{MC}$ = electron efficiency obtained using $Z\rightarrow ee$
events in MC that satisfy the photon selection. 
\end{itemize}

The selection critrea for electrons are the same as those for photons except 
that electrons have a track. The distribution in photon or electron 
identification variables is the similar for isolated photons and electrons. 
Using $Z\rightarrow ee$ events in data, the tag-and-probe method is used to find
the electron efficiency. One electron (tag) is selected with stringent criteria 
to be sure that it is an electron. Another electron (probe) with looser 
requirements is located such that the invariant mass of the two electrons lies 
in the Z peak. \\

The scale factor is found to be $\epsilon_{e}^{data}/\epsilon_{e}^{MC} =
0.953\pm 0.014(stat.)$ for events with at least one jet. Four possible sources
of systematic uncertainty on this number were considered. \\

{\bf Electrons and photons behave differently in MC:} Both electrons and photons
give EM showers in the ECAL and the selection cuts have been chosen to be
similarly efficient for electrons and photons. However, one can imagine that
there may be a slight difference between the two e.g. because of bremsstrahlung.
To check this effect the MC electron efficiency from $Z\rightarrow ee$ events
was compared with the MC photon efficiency from $\gamma$+jet events. Half the
difference between the two results, 0.5\%, was taken as a systematic error on
the scale factor. \\

{\bf Pile-up:} The MC may not accurately model the data in a high pile-up
environment. To estimate the size of this effect the scale factor was calculated
for events with fewer than 5 primary vertices and events with at least 5 primary
vertices. The number 5 was chosen because that is approximately where the 
distribution of primary vertices in the data peaks. The difference between the
scale factors in the two samples, 0.024, was taken as a systematic error on the 
scale factor. \\

{\bf }

Combining the systematic errors above with the statistical error yields a final
data-MC efficiency scale factor of $\epsilon_{e}^{data}/\epsilon_{e}^{MC} =
0.953\pm0.038$.

\section{Jet Energy Scale}

Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters. $\pT$ and
$\eta$ dependent jet energy corrections are applied to the raw calorimeter 
energy to get the jet energy. Any variation in these corrections would change 
the jet $\pT$, the $\HT$ and the $\MET$. \\

The appropriate jet energy corrections are determined from $\gamma$+jet events
in data. The photon is well measured and the event is balanced (within the
$\MET$ resolution). Details of the procedure to determine the jet energy 
corrections and their uncertainties are given in \cite{jec}. This corresponds to
$\sim 3\%$ uncertainty on jets above $50\GeV$ and $\sim 5\%$ uncertainty on 
smaller jets and unclustered energy. Figure \ref{fig:JEC_vs_pT_And_Eta} shows 
the jet energy correction factors as a fucntion of jet $\pT$ for jets with 
($|\eta| = 1.0$) and as a function of $\eta$ for jets with $\pT = 200 \GeV$ (the
core of the jet distribution). \\

\begin{figure}

\caption{The jet energy correction factor as a function of $\pT$ with $\eta =
1.0$ (left) and as a function of $\eta$ with $\pT = 200 \GeV$ (right). Three
diferent jet reconstructions are shown: CALO, JPT and PF. PF jets are used in
this analysis. The bands indicate the corresponding uncertainties.}
\label{fig:JEC_vs_pT_And_Eta}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:JES_Uncertainty_vs_Jet_pT} shows the total jet energy scale 
uncertainty against jet $\pT$ for central jets. \\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{JES_Uncertainty_vs_Jet_pT.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The total jet energy scale uncertainty as a function of $\pT$ for
central jets. Three diferent jet reconstructions are shown: CALO, JPT and PF. 
PF jets are used in this analysis.}
\label{fig:JES_Uncertainty_vs_Jet_pT}
\end{figure}

The jet energy scale uncertainties have no impact on the background estimation
because that is determined through a data-driven method. However the effect on
the number of expected signal events needs to be evaluated. \\

The $\pT$ of all the jets is modified upward and downward according to the jet 
energy uncertainties before applying the event selection. The $\MET$ can be 
expressed as Equation \ref{eq:MET}.

\begin{equation}
\MET = -\Sigma \mbox{ jets} - \mbox{photon} - \mbox{unclustered energy}
\label{eq:MET}
\end{equation}

The $\MET$ is modified to take account of the jet energy correction
uncertainties by the following procedure. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Add the photon to the $\MET$ (i.e. remove it from consideration).
\item Add the jets also to get the unclustered energy.
\item Modify the unclustered energy by 5\%.
\item Subtract the jets scaled according to the jet energy correction 
uncertainties.
\item Subtract the photon to get the modified $\MET$.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:JES_Jet_pT} shows the leading jet $\pT$ distribution with a one 
sigma upward variation and a one sigma downward variation in jet energy scale. 
Figure \ref{fig:JES_MET_And_HT} shows how the variation in jet energy scale 
affects the $\MET$ and $\HT$ distributions. \\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{JES_Jet_pT.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The leading jet $\pT$ distribution in signal events with a one sigma
upward variation (red) and one sigma downward variation (blue) in jet energy
scale.}

events with a one sigma upward variaton (red) and one sigma downward variation
(blue) in jet energy scale.}
\label{fig:JES_MET_And_HT}
\end{figure}

The important result is how the variation in jet energy scale affects the signal
efficiency in each ($\HT$, $\MET$) bin. Figure \ref{fig:JES_Numbers} shows these
numbers. The jet energy scale uncertainties are correlated across all 
($\HT$,$\MET$) bins.

scale is varied by $\pm1\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the jet energy scale
uncertainty.}
\label{fig:JES_Numbers}
\end{figure}

\section{Jet Energy Resolution}

The jet $\pT$ resolution is determined using two different methods: 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Di-jet asymmetry:} This method uses balanced di-jet events which are 
abundant in data and considers $\pT$ conservation. An asymmetry variable is 
constructed from the $\pT$ of the two jets:
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{\pT^{1} - \pT^{2}}{\pT^{1} + \pT^{2}}
\end{equation}
The variance of the asymmetry variable can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{A}^{2} = \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial
\pT^{1}}\right)^{2}\sigma_{\pT^{1}}^{2} + \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial
\pT^{2}}\right)^{2}\sigma_{\pT^{2}}^{2}
\end{equation}
For jets which lie in the same $\eta$ bin and the same $\pT$ bin, the $\pT$'s
are the same and the reslutions are the same so there is an expression for the
fractional $\pT$ resolution in terms of the variance in the asymmetry.
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma_{\pT}}{\pT} = \sqrt{2}\sigma_{A}
\end{equation}  
The asymmetry and the variance in the asymmetry are quantities that can be 
measured in data.
\item {\bf $\gamma$/Z+jet balance:} This method uses $\gamma$+jet or Z+jet
events from data and uses the $\gamma$ or Z as a well measured reference object
to which the jet $\pT$ can be compared. In balanced events the $\gamma$/Z has 
the same $\pT$ as the jet. The ratio, R, of the jet $\pT$ relative to the 
$\gamma$/Z $\pT$ in bins of $\gamma$/Z $\pT$ gives the jet $\pT$ resolution. 
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\pT^{jet}}{\pT^{\gamma/Z}}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Jet_pT_Resolution.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The jet energy resolution measured from data for jets with $|\eta| <
0.5$ (black points) compared to MC (red line). The yellow band gives the
systematic uncertainty. Reproduced from \cite{jec}.}
\label{fig:Jet_pT_Resolution}
\end{figure}

Further details on the jet $\pT$ resolution measurement and determination of the
associated uncertainty can be found in \cite{jec}. The jet $\pT$ resolution as a
function of jet $\pT$ and for $|\eta| < 0.5$ is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:Jet_pT_Resolution}. The figure also shows that MC agrees well with the
data as far as jet enrgy resolution is concerned. For the SUSY events the 
``true'' jet energy comes from the generator level in the MC. The jet energy 
resolution is determined by comparing the reconstructed jet energy with the 
generator level jet energy. This gives a jet $\pT$ resolution similar to that 
measured in \cite{jec}. \\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Resolution.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The jet $\pT$ resolution compared to generator level jets (grey) and
the same distribution after an upward (red) and downward (blue) 
variation of 50\% in the jet $\pT$ resolution.}
\label{fig:Resolution}
\end{figure}

The resolution is varied upward and downward by 50\%, which correspond to the 
uncertainty on the forward jets but is conservative for the central jets. The
variation in resolution is made by changing $\frac{\pT^{reco} -
\pT^{gen}}{\pT^{gen}}$ by 50\% for each jet. Figure \ref{fig:Resolution}
shows the jet energy reolution with an upward and a downward variation. \\

\caption{The effect of an upward (red) and a downward (blue) variation
of the jet $\pT$ resolution on the $\HT$ and $\MET$ distributions.}
\label{fig:JER}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:JER} shows the effect of the variation in resolution on the
$\HT$ and $\MET$ distributions. The important result is how the variation in jet
energy scale affects the signal efficiency in each ($\HT$, $\MET$) bin. Figure 
\ref{fig:JES_Numbers} shows these numbers. The jet energy scale uncertainties 
are correlated across all ($\HT$,$\MET$) bins.

\caption{The percentage change in the signal efficiency when the jet $\pT$
resolution is varied by $\pm1\sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the jet $\pT$ resolution 
uncertainty.}
\label{fig:JER_Numbers}
\end{figure}

\section{Pile-up}

Pile-up is where there are multiple interations per bunch crossing. Pile-up
affects the number of signal events in several ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item The $\HT$ increases due to jets from other interactions in the same bunch
crossing.
\item The $\MET$ distribution is broadened by the introduction of more jets.
\item Reduces the photon isolation efficiency since there is more surrounding
activity which can populate the isolation cone.
\item Can lead to the wrong primary vertex being associated with the photon
which would affect the reconstructed $\pT$.
\end{itemize}

The systematic uncertainty relating to pile-up is evaluated by changing the
smearing by 1\% in either direction.

\section{Signal Cross-Section}

Write how the cross-section is calculated. \\

There is a theoretical uncertainty on the signal cross-section due to the
uncertainty on the PDF distributions. Figure \ref{fig:xsec_unc} shows the
percentage uncertainty on the cross-section for each parameter point in the
mSquark vs mGluino plane.

uncertainties for each parameter point in the mSquark vs mGluino plane.

\label{fig:xsec_unc}
\end{figure}

\section{Integrated Luminosity}

There are a number of different ways of measuring the LHC luminosity. The method
used for early data was to use LHC beam parameters. The luminosity is given by:

\begin{equation}
L = \frac{N^{2}n_{b}f}{A_{eff}}
\label{eq:lumi}
\end{equation}

where N is the number of particles in each of the colliding bunches, $n_{b}$ is
the number of bunches, f is the revolution frequency of the beams and $A_{eff}$
is the effective transverse area in which the collisions occur. \\

The revolution frequency and the number of bunches are known precisely (to $\sim
1\%$) from measurements of the beam current. The limiting uncertainty for the
luminosity measurement is that of $A_{eff}$. The beam sizes must be controlled 
to 20-30\% for safe operation of the LHC. $A_{eff}$ is measured using van der 
Meer scans of the transverse beam profile \cite{vdm_scans}. Assuming a gaussian
transverse beam profile, $A_{eff}$ can be calculated as $A_{eff} = 
4\pi\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}$. The uncertainty on the integrated luminosity 
measurement for this method is $10\%$. \\

The measurement can be improved using TOTEM and W/Z leptonic decays as standard
candles. TOTEM is a forward detector 240m from the interaction point designed to
measure the total proton-proton cross-section. By monitoring the cross-section
over time the integrated luminosity can be estimated. There are still acceptance
and PDF uncertainties associated with the cross-section measurement but these 
give a much smaller error on the integrated luminosity. The uncertainty from
this method is $4\%$.

\section{Summary of Systematics}

Table \ref{tab:Systematics_Summary} shows a summary of all the systematic
uncertainties for the backgrounds and the signal. For simplicity the systematic
uncertainties for only the most significant bin in terms of the limit setting 
($\HT$, $\MET$) = (700+, 200+) are shown.
