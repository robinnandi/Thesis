\section{Introduction}

The Standard Model of particle physics has been proven to be remarkably 
successful at describing nature. W/Z discovery, LEP data Z width, \\

However, there are good reasons to expect that new physics will be discovered at
the LHC. 

\section{Motivation for new physics at the TeV scale}

There are three main motivations for expecting the discovery of new physics at 
the TeV scale.

\begin{itemize}
\item WW scattering
\item Hierarchy Problem
\item Dark Matter candidates
\end{itemize}

WW scattering (among other similar processes) has been observed at LEP, but
there is no mechanism to support such an interaction within the Standard Model.

\section{Supersymmetry}

Supersymmetry partners: fermion <-> boson
maths of the symmetry
solution to WW, hp, dm problems

only possible additional symmetry without violating something serious

SUSY breaking

Gauge Mediated

\section{Strong production Gauge Mediated SUSY breaking}

squark and gluino production

squark mass vs gluino mass phase space 

at least 2 jets - motivated from susy perspective
real MET - susy particles
HT - energy scale of event
high squark mass - at least 4 jets
high gluino mass - 2 jets
