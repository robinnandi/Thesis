\chapter{Signal Prediction and Systematics}

\section{Introduction}

The predicted number of signal events, s, is given by Equation
\ref{eq:Number_of_signal_events}.

\begin{equation}
s = \epsilon \sigma L
\label{eq:Number_of_signal_events}
\end{equation}

where $\epsilon$ is the efficiency $\times$ acceptance for the event selection,
$\sigma$ is the cross section and $L$ is the integrated luminosity. \\

The signal cross section comes from theoretical calculations. A total of 441 
different signal models are considered with different values for squark mass and 
gluino mass. The squark mass and gluino mass each take 21 values from $400 
\unit{GeV}$ to $2000 \unit{GeV}$ in intervals of $80 \unit{GeV}$. The cross 
section is $\sim 0.01 \unit{pb}$ in the region close to exclusion depending on 
the squark and gluino masses. The largest uncertainty in the signal prediction 
comes from the cross section ($\sim 20 \unit{\%}$). \\

The integrated luminosity comes from LHC measurements of the beam. 1.1
$\unit{fb^{-1}}$ of data is used in this analysis. The uncertainty on the 
integrated luminosity is about 5\unit{\%}. \\

The efficiency $\times$ acceptance for the signal is found by applying the 
selection cuts to the signal MC. Corrections need to be made relating to the 
difference between the photon efficiency in data and MC and to account for 
pile-up. In addition to these corrections uncertainties on the signal prediction
need to be determined. These include statistical errors and systematic errors. 
Since 10,000 events were used for each signal point, the statistical error is 
small. It is the systematic error on which attention must be focussed. 
\\

Cuts are made on jets, photons, $\HT$ and $\MET$. The major sources of
uncertainty for the jet and $\HT$ cuts are the jet energy scale and jet energy 
resolution. For the photons the main sources of uncertainty come from the photon
efficiency correction and from pile-up which affects the photon isolation 
efficiency. Both the $\HT$ and $\MET$ distributions are also affected by 
pile-up, but this is a small effect. \\

The numbers and plots relating to the systematic uncertainties presented in this 
section use a signal parameter point close to the exclusion limit with squark 
mass $1200\unit{GeV}$ and gluino mass $1200\unit{GeV}$. The systematic 
uncertainties are also determined for all the other parameter points in the same 
way.

\section{Photon Efficiency Correction}
\label{sec:phoeff}

The photon efficiency needs to be determined to calculate the signal efficiency.
The photon efficiency could be found using the MC, but that relies heavily on
the correct modelling of the shower shape, isolation and other variables which
may not be well modelled in the MC. The photon efficiency is measured from data. 
In the absence of a suitable pure photon sample in the data, electrons from 
$Z\rightarrow ee$ events are used. This relies on the similarity in detector 
response between electrons and photons. A scale factor to correct the MC photon 
efficiency to the real photon efficiency in data is obtained using the electrons 
(Equation \ref{eq:Scale_Factor}). \\

\begin{equation}
\epsilon_{\gamma}^{data} = \frac{\epsilon_{e}^{data}}{\epsilon_{e}^{MC}}
\times \epsilon_{\gamma}^{MC}
\label{eq:Scale_Factor}
\end{equation}  

Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\epsilon_{\gamma}^{data}$ = photon efficiency in data;
\item $\epsilon_{\gamma}^{MC}$ = photon efficiency in MC;
\item $\epsilon_{e}^{data}$ = electron efficiency obtained using $Z\rightarrow
ee$ events in data that satisfy the photon selection; 
\item $\epsilon_{e}^{MC}$ = electron efficiency obtained using $Z\rightarrow ee$
events in MC that satisfy the photon selection. 
\end{itemize}

The selection critrea for electrons are the same as those for photons except 
that electrons have a track. The distribution in photon or electron 
identification variables is similar for isolated photons and electrons. Using 
$Z\rightarrow ee$ events in data, the tag-and-probe method is used to find the 
electron efficiency. One electron (tag) is selected with stringent criteria to 
be sure that it is an electron. Another electron (probe) with looser 
requirements is located such that the invariant mass of the two electrons lies 
in the Z peak. \\

The scale factor is found to be $\epsilon_{e}^{data}/\epsilon_{e}^{MC} =
0.953\pm 0.014(stat.)$ for events with at least one jet. Two possible sources
of systematic uncertainty on this number were considered. \\

{\bf Electrons and photons behave differently in MC:} Both electrons and photons
give EM showers in the ECAL and the selection cuts have been chosen to be
similarly efficient for electrons and photons. However, one can imagine that
there may be a slight difference between the two e.g. because of bremsstrahlung.
To check this effect the MC electron efficiency from $Z\rightarrow ee$ events
was compared with the MC photon efficiency from $\gamma$+jet events. Half the
difference between the two results, 0.5\unit{\%}, was taken as a systematic 
error on the scale factor. \\

{\bf Pile-up:} The MC may not accurately model the data in a high pile-up
environment. To estimate the size of this effect the scale factor was calculated
for events with fewer than 5 primary vertices and events with at least 5 primary
vertices. The number 5 was chosen because that is approximately where the 
distribution of primary vertices in the data peaks. The difference between the
scale factors in the two samples, 0.024, was taken as a systematic error on the 
scale factor. \\

Combining the systematic errors above with the statistical error yields a final
data-MC efficiency scale factor of $\epsilon_{e}^{data}/\epsilon_{e}^{MC} =
0.953\pm0.038$. This uncertainty on the scale factor translates into an 
uncertainty of 3.8\% on the signal prediction.

\section{Jet Energy Scale}

Jets are reconstructed from energy deposits in the calorimeters. $\pT$ and
$\eta$ dependent jet energy corrections are applied to the raw calorimeter 
energy to get the jet energy. Any variation in these corrections would change 
the jet $\pT$, the $\HT$ and the $\MET$. \\

The appropriate jet energy corrections are determined from $\gamma$+jet events
in data. The photon is used as a reference object because its energy is well 
measured by the ECAL. The response $\frac{p_{T}^{jet}}{p_{T}^{\gamma}}$
is measured in bins of jet $p_{T}$ and $\eta$ to get the jet energy corrections. 
Details of the procedure to determine the jet energy corrections and their 
uncertainties are given in \cite{jec}. Figure \ref{fig:JEC_vs_pT_And_Eta} shows 
the jet energy correction factors as a fucntion of jet $\pT$ for jets with 
$|\eta| = 1.0$ and as a function of $\eta$ for jets with $\pT = 200 \unit{GeV}$. 
\\

\begin{figure}

\caption{The jet energy correction factor as a function of $\pT$ with $\eta =
1.0$ (left) and as a function of $\eta$ with $\pT = 200 \unit{GeV}$ (right). 
Three diferent jet reconstructions are shown: CALO, JPT and PF. PF jets are used 
in this analysis. The bands indicate the corresponding uncertainties. Reproduced
from \cite{jec}}
\label{fig:JEC_vs_pT_And_Eta}
\end{figure}

The uncertainty is $\sim 2 \unit{\%}$ on jets above $50 \unit{GeV}$ and $\sim 5 
\unit{\%}$ on smaller jets and unclustered energy. Figure \ref{fig:JES_Unc_pT} 
shows the jet energy scale uncertainty against jet $\pT$ for central jets and 
Figure \ref{fig:JES_Unc_Eta} shows the jet energy scale uncertainty against jet
$\eta$ for $100\unit{GeV}$ jets. \\

\end{center}
\caption{The jet energy scale uncertainty as a function of $\pT$ for
central jets ($|\eta| < 0.3$).}

\end{figure}

\end{center}
\caption{The jet energy scale uncertainty as a function of $\eta$ for
$100\unit{GeV}$ jets.}
\label{fig:JES_Unc_Eta}
\end{figure}

The $\pT$ of all the jets is modified upward and downward according to the jet 
energy uncertainties before applying the event selection. The $\MET$ can be 
expressed as Equation \ref{eq:MET}.

\begin{equation}
\MET = -\Sigma \mbox{ jets} - \mbox{photon} - \mbox{unclustered energy}
\label{eq:MET}
\end{equation}

The $\MET$ is modified to take account of the jet energy correction
uncertainties by the following procedure. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Add the photon to the $\MET$ (i.e. remove it from consideration).
\item Add the jets also to get the unclustered energy.
\item Modify the unclustered energy by $5\unit{\%}$.
\item Subtract the jets scaled according to the jet energy correction 
uncertainties.
\item Subtract the photon to get the modified $\MET$.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:JES_Jet_pT} shows the leading jet $\pT$ distribution with a one 
sigma upward variation and a one sigma downward variation in jet energy scale. 
Figure \ref{fig:JES_MET_And_HT} shows how the variation in jet energy scale 
affects the $\MET$ and $\HT$ distributions. \\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{JES_Jet_pT.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The leading jet $\pT$ distribution in signal events with a one sigma
upward variation (red) and one sigma downward variation (blue) in jet energy
scale.}
\label{fig:JES_Jet_pT}
\end{figure}

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{JES_HT.pdf}
\caption{The $\MET$ distribution (left) and $\HT$ distribution (right) in signal
events with a one sigma upward variaton (red) and one sigma downward variation
(blue) in jet energy scale.}
\label{fig:JES_MET_And_HT}
\end{figure}

The important result is how the variation in jet energy scale affects the signal
efficiency. The signal efficiency is $0.382\pm0.017$ when the jet energy scale
is varied within its uncertainty. This means the uncertainty on the signal
efficiency from the jet energy scale is 4.4\unit{\%}.

\section{Jet Energy Resolution}

The jet $\pT$ resolution is determined using two different methods: 

\begin{itemize}
\item {\bf Di-jet asymmetry:} This method uses balanced di-jet events which are 
abundant in data and considers $\pT$ conservation. An asymmetry variable is 
constructed from the $\pT$ of the two jets:
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{\pT^{1} - \pT^{2}}{\pT^{1} + \pT^{2}}
\end{equation}
The variance of the asymmetry variable can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
\sigma_{A}^{2} = \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial
\pT^{1}}\right)^{2}\sigma_{\pT^{1}}^{2} + \left(\frac{\partial A}{\partial
\pT^{2}}\right)^{2}\sigma_{\pT^{2}}^{2}
\end{equation}
For jets which lie in the same $\eta$ bin and the same $\pT$ bin, the $\pT$'s
are the same and the reslutions are the same so there is an expression for the
fractional $\pT$ resolution in terms of the variance in the asymmetry which can
be measured in the data:
\begin{equation}
\frac{\sigma_{\pT}}{\pT} = \sqrt{2}\sigma_{A}
\end{equation}  
\item {\bf $\gamma$/Z+jet balance:} This method uses $\gamma$+jet or Z+jet
events from data and uses the $\gamma$ or Z as a well measured reference object
to which the jet $\pT$ can be compared. In balanced events the $\gamma$/Z has 
the same $\pT$ as the jet. The ratio, R, of the jet $\pT$ relative to the 
$\gamma$/Z $\pT$ in bins of $\gamma$/Z $\pT$ gives the jet $\pT$ resolution. 
\begin{equation}
R = \frac{\pT^{jet}}{\pT^{\gamma/Z}}
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{jet_res.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The jet energy resolution measured from data for jets with $|\eta| <
0.5$ (black points) compared to MC (red line). The yellow band gives the
systematic uncertainty. Reproduced from \cite{jec}.}
\label{fig:jet_res}
\end{figure}

Further details on the jet $\pT$ resolution measurement and determination of the
associated uncertainty can be found in \cite{jec}. The jet $\pT$ resolution as a
function of jet $\pT$ and for $|\eta| < 0.5$ is shown in Figure
\ref{fig:jet_res}. The figure also shows that MC agrees well with the
data as far as jet energy resolution is concerned. For the SUSY events the 
``true'' jet energy comes from the generator level in the MC. The jet energy 
resolution is determined by comparing the reconstructed jet energy with the 
generator level jet energy. This gives a jet $\pT$ resolution similar to that 
measured in \cite{jec}. \\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Jet_Pt_Resolution.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The jet $\pT$ resolution compared to generator level jets (grey) and
the same distribution after an upward (red) and downward (blue) 
variation of 50\unit{\%} in the jet $\pT$ resolution.}
\label{fig:Resolution}
\end{figure}

The resolution is varied upward and downward by 50\unit{\%}, which correspond to 
the uncertainty on the forward jets but is conservative for the central jets. 
The variation in resolution is made by changing $\frac{\pT^{reco} -
\pT^{gen}}{\pT^{gen}}$ by 50\unit{\%} for each jet. Figure \ref{fig:Resolution}
shows the jet energy reolution with an upward and a downward variation. \\

\caption{The effect of an upward (red) and a downward (blue) variation
of the jet $\pT$ resolution on the $\HT$ and $\MET$ distributions.}
\label{fig:JER}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:JER} shows the effect of the variation in resolution on the
$\HT$ and $\MET$ distributions. The important result is how the variation in jet 
energy resolution affects the signal efficiency. The signal efficiency is 
$0.382\pm0.005$ when the jet energy resolution is varied within its uncertainty. 
This means the uncertainty on the signal efficiency from the jet energy
resolution is 1.2\unit{\%}.

\section{Pile-up}

Pile-up is where there are multiple interations per bunch crossing. Pile-up 
affects the number of signal events in several ways:

\begin{itemize}
\item The $\HT$ increases due to jets and underlying event activity from other 
interactions in the same bunch crossing.
\item The $\MET$ distribution is broadened by the introduction of more jets and
underlying event activity.
\item The photon isolation efficiency is reduced since there is more 
surrounding activity which can populate the isolation cone.
\end{itemize}

Most of the pile-up events are soft with, at most, low $\pT$ jets and do not
contribute much to $\HT$. Since the signal MC does not have pile-up simulated, 
the effect of pile-up on the $\HT$ is evaluated by looking at the $\HT$ 
distribution in MC QCD events with and without pile-up. A shift of $7.0\pm0.8$ 
is applied to the no pile-up $\HT$ distribution to match the pile-up $\HT$ 
distribution (Figure \ref{fig:Pile_Up_HT}). With a $\pm1\sigma$ variation in 
the $\HT$ shift the signal efficiency is $0.3821\pm0.0003$, an uncertainty of
$0.1\unit{\%}$. \\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Pile_Up_HT.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The mean $\HT$ as a function of $\HT$ shift (red) with one sigma band 
(yellow) in QCD events with a similar $\HT$ to the signal. The mean $\HT$ with 
pile-up is shown in black.}
\label{fig:Pile_Up_HT}
\end{figure}

The $\MET$ distribution is broadened by the introduction of more jets and
underlying event activity from other interactions in the same bunch crossing. 
The pile-up events will mostly be low $\HT$ and balanced so will have only a 
little effect on the $\MET$. The $\MET$ distribution is smeared to account for 
pile-up. To determine the amount of smearing necessary a QCD sample with similar 
$\HT$ and no pile-up is smeared until the shape agrees with the $\MET$ 
distribution with pile-up. Figure \ref{fig:Pile_Up_MET} shows the 
average $\MET$ in QCD events without pile-up as a function of the $\MET$ 
smearing. From the plot a $\MET$ smearing of $5.6\pm1.0\unit{GeV}$ is applied to 
account for pile-up. The important number is the uncertainty in
the signal efficiency due to the uncertainty in the $\MET$ smearing to account
for pile-up, which is found to be $0.3821\pm0.0004$. This corresponds to an
uncertainty of $0.1\unit{\%}$.\\

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{Pile_Up_MET.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{The mean $\MET$ as a function of $\MET$ smearing (red) with one sigma
band (yellow) in QCD events with a similar $\HT$ to the signal. The mean $\MET$ 
with pile-up is shown in black.}
\label{fig:Pile_Up_MET}
\end{figure}

The photon isolation efficiency is particularly affected by pile-up because
activity from other events in the same bunch crossing can populate the isolation
cone. To quantify this effect QCD MC events with a similar $\HT$ were used to
determine the photon efficiency in MC as a function of the number of primary
vertices. Figure \ref{fig:Efficiency_vs_nVertices} shows the photon efficiency
as a function of the number of primary vertices. The efficiency is shown
relative to the efficiency when there is only a single reconstructed primary
vertex. Taking the distribution of number of primary vertices from data, the 
efficiency expected in the presence of pile-up can be calculated. This method 
assumes that photons in SUSY events have a similar behaviour in the presence of 
pile-up to photons in QCD events. This assumption is reasonable beacause the 
pile-up affects mainly the isolation through extra surrounding activity which is 
a property of the event rather than the photon. This method also relies on MC 
modelling the photon efficiency in pile-up well. This can be checked by looking 
at $Z\rightarrow ee$ events in data. The efficiency requires only a small 
correction between data and MC which is relatively stable with respect to the
number of reconstructed primary vertices (Figure \ref{fig:EffCorr_vs_nPV}). The 
efficiency correction due to pile-up is found to be 
$0.83\pm0.01(stat.)\pm0.01(syst.)$. This produces an uncertainty of 
$3.8\unit{\%}$ on the signal efficiency.

\section{Signal Cross-Section}
\label{sec:xsec}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{QCDFactorization.png}
\end{center}
\caption{In proton collisions the cross-section must be factorised into the 
individual parton cross-sections.}
\label{fig:QCDFactorization}
\end{figure}

To calculate the cross-section for $p + p \rightarrow X$, the parton collision 
$a + b \rightarrow X$ must first be considered (Figure 
\ref{fig:QCDFactorization}). The cross-section for partons $a$ and $b$ with 
momentum fractions $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ is calculated. To get the cross-section 
from protons the parton density functions must be folded in and the possible 
partons must be summed over as in Equation \ref{eq:xsec_factorisation}.

\begin{equation}
\sigma(s) =
\displaystyle\sum\limits_{a,b}\int_{0}^{1}dx_{1}\int_{0}^{1}dx_{2}f_{a}(x_{1},Q^{2})f_{b}(x_{2},Q^{2})\sigma_{ab}(\hat{s})
\label{eq:xsec_factorisation}
\end{equation}

The cross-section for the parton process $a + b \rightarrow X$ is an infinte sum
over terms corresponding to processes with extra vertices and radiations as in
Equation \ref{eq:xsec_series}. The terms get smaller as more vertices are 
introduced. To do the calculation the series must be cut off at some order. Here
the series is cut off at Next to Leading Order (NLO).

\begin{equation}
\sigma = \sigma_{LO} + \sigma_{NLO} + ...
\label{eq:xsec_series}
\end{equation}

There are two major sources of uncertainty on the signal cross-section:

\begin{itemize} 
\item The uncertainties on the PDFs.
\item The uncertainty from higher order terms.
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:xsec_unc} shows the cross-section and total percentage 
uncertainty for each parameter point in the mSquark vs mGluino plane.

each parameter point in the mSquark vs mGluino plane. Reproduced from 
\cite{ra3}.}
\label{fig:xsec_unc}
\end{figure}

\section{Integrated Luminosity}

The LHC beam luminosity can be measured from the beam parameters as in Equation
\ref{eq:lumi}.

\begin{equation}
L = \frac{N^{2}n_{b}f}{A_{eff}}
\label{eq:lumi}
\end{equation}

where N is the number of particles in each of the colliding bunches, $n_{b}$ is
the number of bunches, f is the revolution frequency of the beams and $A_{eff}$
is the effective transverse area in which the collisions occur. \\

The revolution frequency and the number of bunches are known precisely (to $\sim
1\unit{\%}$) from measurements of the beam current. The limiting uncertainty for 
the luminosity measurement is that of $A_{eff}$. The beam sizes must be 
controlled to $20-30\unit{\%}$ for safe operation of the LHC. $A_{eff}$ is 
measured using van der Meer scans of the transverse beam profile 
\cite{vdm_scans}. Assuming a gaussian transverse beam profile, $A_{eff}$ can be 
calculated as $A_{eff} = 4\pi\sigma_{x}\sigma_{y}$. The uncertainty on the 
integrated luminosity measurement for this method is $5\unit{\%}$. \\

\section{Summary of Systematics}

Table \ref{tab:Systematics_Summary} shows a summary of all the systematic
uncertainties for the backgrounds and the signal. These are the uncertainties on
the number of events in the ($\HT>700\unit{GeV}$, $\MET>200\unit{GeV}$) bin. A
GMSB parameter point close to exclusion with squark mass $1200\unit{GeV}$ and 
gluino mass $1200\unit{GeV}$ is used for the signal uncertainties.
